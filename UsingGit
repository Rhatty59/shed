How to use Git Hub
CD to shed directory
git fetch
if change found git merge name of change
work on programming
Git status shows files changed
if in red: git add <filename>
git status : should now be in green
do regular git commit -m "<message>"  which commits locally
once finished for the day: git push origin master
That will save it to the hub
